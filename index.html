                                While working in Start Smart, I got to realize my new skills and abilities of what I can do and what I must try more. I gained a lot of work experience such as developing training programs for volunteers, recruiting new volunteers and other great projects. On the other hand, I also improved in soft skills such as communication skills, leadership skills, presentation skills, time management skills and much more. I could also join fun and memorable workshops which could help me to gain a lot of valuable knowledge and also widen my social network by meeting new great friends through those workshops. As a part of the organization, I was able to share my ideas and opinions with everyone. Being able to receive others’ opinions helps me gain much more knowledge too. As I got these valuable experiences, I feel delighted that I am a part of Start Smart that focuses on creating a better community for everyone.

Each has its respective strengths and weaknesses. In Start Smart, I am a Co-Leader of Public Relations. As a co-leader, I have to organize the team's working plans and decide some decisions with the Leader. Management skills, problem-solving skills, Leadership skills, are enormously increasing since my first day at start smart. The working environment is full of positive impacts, all of the teammates are hardworking, energetic, and unite. We as the public relations team are trying our best to achieve the respective goals of Start Smart.

                                            By arranging weekly meetings, assigning tasks for each person has improved. As a member of the PD team, the experience of running programs/classes has gained as well. In addition, I also would like to mention that problem solving skills are also getting better while trying to polish up the programs according to feedback. Next, communication ,with team members or invited guest speakers ,has also developed while arranging new programs. Last but not least, by volunteering in an organisation of family-like warm-hearted members, I have got tons of experience in learning to work well with a team.

We have training which is needed to develop or know in this organization so we got experience and knowledge that we don't know. I have improved in communication skills,time management and many other aspects. We had to check things before we did the jobs so I also improved in doing the job properly. In Finance team, we need to work carefully that we don't make any mistakes so I carefully do the job that assigned to me.So, I got many experiences and improved in skills.

                                        I had many interesting experiences because of the different positions while working about 2 months in Start Smart. I was taken on as an Operational Officer of Finance Team by Our active & energetic Founder. Firstly, I felt the difficulties for this position.As I couldn't keep in touch with the role of Finance, I had the seriousness of this position. But I went absolutely wrong. It was so easy to understand the process of this work because of Our good-natured Leader of the Finance Team. Moreover, as I had other colleagues to discuss & work together, I didn't have any difficulties. By the way, I got much knowledge from the workshops for the team members. In a nutshell, I want to support & help together for the perpetuation of Our Start Smart Organization year by year.

Volunteering never fails ! That experience will help you to  get to know about the job arrangements really well.
