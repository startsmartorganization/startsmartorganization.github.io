                                While working in Start Smart, I got to realize my new skills and abilities of what I can do and what I must try more. I gained a lot of work experience such as developing training programs for volunteers, recruiting new volunteers and other great projects. On the other hand, I also improved in soft skills such as communication skills, leadership skills, presentation skills, time management skills and much more. I could also join fun and memorable workshops which could help me to gain a lot of valuable knowledge and also widen my social network by meeting new great friends through those workshops. As a part of the organization, I was able to share my ideas and opinions with everyone. Being able to receive others’ opinions helps me gain much more knowledge too. As I got these valuable experiences, I feel delighted that I am a part of Start Smart that focuses on creating a better community for everyone.

                                    I’ve learned how to work well as a team. I think my communication skills also improved as I have to communicate with both my teammates and public. As a PR officer, I assist leader, co-leader and facilitate in workshops. Moreover, I learnt how to use google tools well. Although this is my first time volunteering, I can feel the warmth from my members. They never fail to help me whenever I need help. It is a pleasure for me to work together in Start Smart. Start Smart makes me realize what a team means. It is just like my second family. This volunteering experience will always be one of the unforgettable events of my life.

                                            By arranging weekly meetings, assigning tasks for each person has improved. As a member of PD team, the experience of running programs/classes has gained as well. In addition, I also would like to mention that problem solving skill is also getting better while trying to polish up the programs according to feedbacks. Next, communication ,with team members or invited guest speakers ,has also developed while arranging new programs. Last but not least, by volunteering in an organisation of family-like warm-hearted members, I have got tons of experience in learning work well with team.

                                        I had got many interesting experiences because of the different positions while working about 2 months in Start Smart. Before I am working as an Operational Officer in Finance Team , I worked as a Volunteer Assistant Teacher for Personal Development Class. At that time , I was a bridge between the teachers & the students. I met a lot of people with different attitudes. Sometimes, when I felt down, I motivated & energized because of my lovely, helpful & good-natured colleagues. So, my communication skill was broadened by working with teammates. I do believe I could establish a hearty & warm environment. After that, I was taken on as an Operational Officer of Finance Team by Our active & energetic Founder. Firstly, I felt the differences between the first position & the next. As I couldn't keep in touch with role of Finance, I had seriousness of this position. But I went absolutely wrong. I was so easy to understand the process of this work because of Our good-natured Leader of Finance Team. Moreover, as I had another colleagues to discuss & work together, I didn't have any difficulties. By the way, I had got much knowledge by the workshops for the team members. In a nutshell, I want to say thanks a million to Our Founder, my younger sister, Wint Wah for giving me a great chance to work with Start Smart Organization. I want to support & help together for the perpetuation of Our Start Smart Organization year by year.

                                            Working with a team is good. I got a lot of experiences by working as a volunteer at Start Smart. I've got to know new people, new faces, new friends, also the community to which I belong. Start Smart held many workshops so you have chances to get knowledges and some useable life skills. But for me, I was doing self-study at home, so it wasn't like you joined a class and then the schedule is automatically arranged. I didn't make to attend workshops, so I didn't get to talk casually with other teams so I wasn't well-known. But As Start Smart is an organization with a lot of teams and members, I hope every members including me somehow get family vibes.
Volunteering never fails ! That experience will help you to  get to know about the job arrangements really well.
